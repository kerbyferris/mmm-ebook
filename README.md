# The Triple M Book

Rust utility for converting the
<a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com" target="_blank">Mr. Money Mustache</a>
blog to the EPUB file format, for people who prefer reading on their ebooks to
online.

## Usage

Generate a new, up-to-date `output/mmm.epub` file with:

```sh
cargo run
```

Optionally, download this repo's latest version of the book
[here](https://github.com/kerbyferris/mmm-ebook/raw/main/output/mmm.epub).

NOTE: Images require an internet connection to view, which can be a
disappointing experience on an airplane :/
